- execute and redirect output to a file

In vim:
- Edit a .yaml file
- type `play` and then _\<tab\>_, it will fill the start of the playbook
- the cursor will be placed on the next token, for playbook this is the hosts
  variable, you can then jump between tokens with _\<tab\>_ and _\<S-tab\>_
- then you can add an action for a given module by typing the name of the module
  followed by _\<tab\>_
